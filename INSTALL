INSTALL - ESP Package Manager (EPM) 4.2
---------------------------------------

Complete installation instructions can be found in the file
"doc/epm-book.html"...


WHAT IS REQUIRED FOR EPM?

    On your development system you just need a C compiler, a make
    program, the Bourne (or Korn or Bash) shell, and gzip.

    The graphical setup program needs a C++ compiler and the
    FLTK library, version 1.1 or higher, available at
    "http://www.fltk.org".

    EPM can generate so-called "portable" distributions that are
    based on shell scripts and tar files.  For these types of
    distributions your customers/users will need the Bourne (or
    Korn or Bash) shell, a tar program, and GNU zip. The first
    two are standard items, and GNU zip is being shipped by most
    vendors as well.

    EPM can also generate vendor-specific distributions.  These
    require the particular vendor tool (rpm, dpkg, etc.) to load
    the software.


HOW DO I COMPILE EPM?

    EPM uses GNU autoconf to configure itself for your system. 
    To build it, use:

        ./configure ENTER
	make ENTER

    The default installation prefix is /usr; if you want to put
    EPM in /usr/local, do:

        ./configure --prefix=/usr/local ENTER
	make ENTER

    Once EPM is compiled you can type:

        su ENTER
	make install ENTER

    to install the software in /usr/bin.
